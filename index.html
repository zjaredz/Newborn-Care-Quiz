                    "Within the first 6 hours after birth",
                    "Within the first 24-48 hours after birth",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Newborns should pass meconium (their first stool) within 24-48 hours after birth. Meconium is dark, tarry, and odorless. Failure to pass meconium within this timeframe may indicate intestinal obstruction or other gastrointestinal issues. Healthcare providers monitor this closely as delayed passage can signal conditions like Hirschsprung's disease or meconium ileus. After meconium passes, stools gradually transition to yellow, seedy consistency in breastfed babies or firmer, tan-colored stools in formula-fed babies."

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The optimal room temperature for newborn sleep is 68-70°F (20-21°C). This temperature range helps prevent overheating, which is a risk factor for SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Newborns have immature thermoregulation systems and can overheat easily. Signs of overheating include sweating, damp hair, flushed cheeks, heat rash, and rapid breathing. Dress babies in light sleep clothing and use a sleep sack instead of loose blankets. Feel the baby's chest or back of neck to check if they're too warm or cool."

                  options: [
                    "Every 4-5 hours or 4-6 times per day",
                    "Every 2-3 hours or 8-12 times per day",
                    "Every hour during the day, every 3 hours at night",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Newborns should breastfeed every 2-3 hours, totaling 8-12 times in 24 hours during the first few days of life. This frequent feeding helps establish milk supply, prevents dehydration and jaundice, and supports proper weight gain. Newborns have small stomachs (about the size of a marble on day 1) and breast milk digests quickly. Watch for feeding cues like rooting, lip smacking, and hand-to-mouth movements. While demand feeding is important, newborns may need gentle encouragement to feed frequently enough, especially if sleepy or jaundiced."

                    "3-5 days after birth",
                    "1-2 weeks after birth",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "The umbilical cord stump typically falls off within 1-2 weeks after birth, usually around 10-14 days. Keep the area clean and dry - fold diapers below the cord to prevent urine contact. Give sponge baths until the cord falls off and the area heals completely. Signs of infection include redness around the base, foul odor, discharge, or bleeding beyond a few drops when the cord detaches. Some babies may have a small granuloma (pink, moist tissue) after the cord falls off, which usually resolves on its own but should be evaluated by a healthcare provider."

                {
                  question: "What is the normal weight loss range for newborns in the first few days of life?",
                  options: [
                    "1-3% of birth weight",
                    "5-10% of birth weight",
                    "10-15% of birth weight",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Normal newborn weight loss is 5-10% of birth weight in the first few days of life. This occurs due to fluid loss, passage of meconium, and small initial feeding volumes while breastfeeding is establishing. Babies typically regain their birth weight by 10-14 days of age. Weight loss exceeding 10% requires close monitoring and possible intervention. Factors affecting weight loss include feeding method, birth weight, gestational age, and maternal IV fluids during labor. Daily weight checks help monitor progress, and healthcare providers may recommend supplementation if weight loss is excessive."

                  question: "Which postpartum warning sign requires immediate medical attention?",

                    "Mild cramping during breastfeeding",
                    "Soaking more than one pad per hour for two consecutive hours",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Soaking more than one pad per hour for two consecutive hours indicates excessive postpartum bleeding (hemorrhage) and requires immediate medical attention. Normal postpartum bleeding (lochia) is heaviest in the first few days but should gradually decrease. Other emergency warning signs include: fever over 100.4°F, severe headache, visual changes, severe abdominal pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, calf pain or swelling, and thoughts of harming yourself or baby. Mild cramping during nursing, mood changes, and breast engorgement are normal postpartum experiences but should be monitored."

                  question: "What is the appropriate response to a newborn's fontanelles (soft spots)?",
                  options: [
                    "Apply gentle pressure to help them close faster",
                    "Avoid touching them completely as they're extremely fragile",
                    "They can be gently touched during normal care activities",
                    "Cover them with protective padding at all times"
                  ],
                  correct: 2,
                  explanation: "Fontanelles can be gently touched during normal care activities like hair washing and are protected by a tough membrane. The anterior fontanelle (diamond-shaped, larger) typically closes between 12-18 months, while the posterior fontanelle (triangular, smaller) closes by 2-3 months. A sunken fontanelle may indicate dehydration, while a bulging fontanelle when the baby is upright and calm may suggest increased intracranial pressure. Pulsation is normal and reflects the heartbeat. Never apply pressure to close them - this occurs naturally as skull bones grow together."

                {
                  question: "What is the correct technique for burping a newborn?",
                  options: [
                    "Pat firmly on the lower back to force air out quickly",
                    "Hold upright and pat or rub gently on the upper back",
                    "Lay baby flat and press on the stomach",
                    "Turn baby upside down and pat the back"
                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Hold the baby upright against your chest or sitting on your lap, supporting the head and neck, and gently pat or rub the upper back to help release trapped air. Three effective positions include: upright against your chest, sitting on your lap leaning forward with support, or lying face-down across your lap. Burp babies after every 1-2 ounces during bottle feeding or when switching breasts. Not all babies need to burp after every feeding. Gentle, patient attempts for 3-5 minutes are usually sufficient. Avoid forceful patting or pressing on the stomach."

                  question: "When do newborn reflexes typically begin to disappear?",
                  options: [
                    "Within the first 2 weeks",
                    "Around 3-6 months as voluntary control develops",
                    "After the first year of life",
                    "They remain throughout childhood"
                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Most newborn reflexes begin disappearing around 3-6 months as the nervous system matures and voluntary muscle control develops. The Moro reflex typically disappears by 3-4 months, rooting and sucking reflexes fade around 3-4 months (in awake babies), and the grasp reflex usually disappears by 3-6 months. Persistence of primitive reflexes beyond expected timeframes may indicate neurological concerns and should be evaluated. These reflexes are replaced by purposeful, voluntary movements as the brain develops. Some reflexes, like blinking and swallowing, remain throughout life."

                  question: "What is the safest way to bathe a newborn in the first weeks?",
                  options: [
                    "Full immersion baths in deep water for thorough cleaning",
                    "Sponge baths until the umbilical cord heals completely",
                    "Quick rinses under running water",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Give sponge baths until the umbilical cord stump falls off and heals completely (usually 1-2 weeks). This prevents infection and keeps the cord area dry. Use warm (not hot) water, mild baby soap, and wash one area at a time while keeping the rest of the baby covered and warm. Start with face and work down to diaper area, cleaning thoroughly but gently. After cord healing, use 2-3 inches of warm water in a baby tub. Newborns don't get very dirty and don't need daily baths - 2-3 times per week is sufficient unless there are diaper leaks or spit-up."

                  question: "How should parents respond to normal newborn crying patterns?",
                  options: [
                    "Let babies cry it out to develop independence",
                    "Pick up immediately every time to prevent spoiling",
                    "Respond consistently while learning baby's cues and needs",
                    "Only respond to crying during daytime hours"
                  ],
                  correct: 2,
                  explanation: "Respond consistently to crying while learning to distinguish different types of cries and your baby's individual patterns. Newborns cry for various reasons: hunger, discomfort, tiredness, overstimulation, or need for comfort. Normal newborns cry 1-3 hours daily, often more in the evening. You cannot spoil a newborn by responding to cries. Try the 5 S's: swaddling, side/stomach position (when awake and supervised), shushing, swinging, and sucking. If crying seems excessive (over 3 hours daily for several days), persists despite meeting needs, or seems painful, consult healthcare providers."

                  question: "What is the recommended approach to tummy time for newborns?",
                  options: [
                    "Start with 30-minute sessions from birth",
                    "Begin with 3-5 minutes several times daily while awake and supervised",
                    "Only after 3 months when neck muscles are stronger",
                    "Avoid completely until baby can roll over"
                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Begin tummy time with 3-5 minutes several times daily from the first week of life, always when baby is awake and supervised. Gradually increase duration as baby tolerates and enjoys it. Tummy time strengthens neck, shoulder, and back muscles, promotes motor development, and helps prevent flat head syndrome (positional plagiocephaly). Start on your chest, progress to firm surfaces like play mats. If baby fusses, try shorter sessions or different positions. Aim for 15-30 minutes total daily by 7 weeks old. Never leave baby unattended during tummy time, and always place baby on back for sleep."

                  question: "What characterizes normal newborn sleep patterns?",
                  options: [
                    "8-hour stretches at night from birth",
                    "14-17 hours daily in 2-4 hour stretches with no day-night distinction",

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Newborns sleep 14-17 hours per day in 2-4 hour stretches with no clear day-night distinction initially. They have shorter sleep cycles (50-60 minutes vs. adult 90-120 minutes) and spend more time in REM sleep, which is important for brain development. Newborns wake frequently for feeding and comfort, which is normal and necessary. Day-night patterns begin emerging around 6-8 weeks, with longer sleep stretches developing gradually. Create gentle routines by exposing baby to natural light during day feedings and keeping nighttime interactions calm and dim."

                  ],
                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Be concerned about jaundice that appears within the first 24 hours (pathologic), involves severe yellowing extending to palms and soles, persists beyond 2-3 weeks, or is accompanied by poor feeding, lethargy, or high-pitched crying. Physiologic jaundice typically appears 2-3 days after birth, peaks around day 5, and resolves by 1-2 weeks. Risk factors include prematurity, blood type incompatibility, bruising during delivery, and inadequate feeding. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs with poor intake, while breast milk jaundice can persist longer but is usually harmless. Severe jaundice can cause brain damage, so prompt evaluation is crucial."

                  ],
                  correct: 2,
                  explanation: "Clean each eye from inner corner to outer corner using a separate, clean, damp cloth or cotton ball for each eye to prevent cross-contamination. Use plain warm water - no soap or cleansers near the eyes. This technique helps prevent infection and clears normal discharge. Newborns often have sticky or discharge from eyes due to immature tear ducts, blocked ducts, or normal adaptation. Gentle massage of the tear duct (inner corner) may help drainage.

                  explanation: "Monitor hydration by counting wet diapers (should have 6+ per day after day 4), observing alertness and activity level, checking for moist mucous membranes, and noting skin elasticity. Signs of dehydration include fewer wet diapers, dark yellow urine, dry mouth, sunken fontanelle, lethargy, and excessive sleepiness. Breastfed babies get adequate fluids from breast milk alone - additional water is not needed and can be dangerous. Formula-fed babies also don't need extra water. If concerned about hydration, consult healthcare providers rather than giving water, which can cause water intoxication and interfere with feeding."

They're caused by the developing diaphragm and are often triggered by feeding, temperature changes, or excitement. Hiccups typically don't bother babies as much as they might adults. Never give water to newborns under 6 months as it can cause water intoxication and interfere with nutrition. Gentle burping, changing position, or offering breast/pacifier may help, but patience is often the best approach. Persistent hiccups lasting hours or interfering with feeding should be discussed with healthcare providers."

Normal healing includes mild swelling, slight redness, and yellow discharge or scabbing as the area heals. Keep the area clean and dry, apply petroleum jelly or prescribed ointment, and change diapers frequently. The plastic ring (if used) typically falls off in 7-10 days. Some fussiness is normal, but excessive crying or signs of severe pain warrant medical evaluation. Complete healing usually occurs within 1-2 weeks."

                  explanation: "Normal axillary (armpit) temperature for newborns is 97.7-99.5°F (36.5-37.5°C). Newborns have immature thermoregulation and can lose heat quickly through their large head surface area. Check temperature by feeling the chest or back of neck - hands and feet are often cooler and not reliable indicators. Signs of proper temperature regulation include appropriate activity level, good color, and comfort. Overheating signs include sweating, flushed skin, rapid breathing, and irritability.

                  explanation: "Combine responsive feeding (watching for baby's hunger cues) with ensuring adequate feeding frequency of 8-12 times per day. Early hunger cues include rooting, lip smacking, hand-to-mouth movements, and increased alertness. Don't wait for crying, which is a late hunger sign. While following baby's natural rhythms is important, newborns may be too sleepy or weak to demand food frequently enough, especially in the first few days. Gentle encouragement may be needed. Track feeding frequency and duration, wet diapers, and weight gain to ensure adequacy. Consult healthcare providers if concerns arise about feeding patterns."

                  explanation: "Vernix caseosa is the white, waxy coating that protects baby's skin in utero and provides natural moisturizing and antimicrobial benefits after birth. It's completely normal and beneficial - there's no need to rush its removal. Vernix helps regulate temperature, provides a barrier against bacteria, and keeps skin moisturized during the transition to air breathing. Babies born earlier tend to have more vernix, while post-term babies may have less. It will absorb naturally into the skin or can be gently wiped away during routine care. Modern practice often involves leaving vernix intact during initial care to maximize its protective benefits."

                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Start talking, reading, and singing to your newborn immediately from birth to support early language development and bonding. Newborns can hear well at birth (hearing is actually fully developed before birth) and are programmed to prefer human voices, especially their parents'. Early language exposure supports brain development, teaches communication patterns, and strengthens emotional bonds. Use 'parentese' - higher pitch, slower tempo, exaggerated intonation - which babies prefer. Describe daily activities, read simple books, and respond to baby's sounds and expressions. This early interaction lays the foundation for later language skills and cognitive development."

                  correct: 1,
                  explanation: "Always support both the head and neck together as one unit, allowing natural positioning while preventing the head from falling backward or to the side. Newborns have large, heavy heads relative to their body size and weak neck muscles that can't support the head's weight. Use one hand to cradle the back of the head and neck when lifting, carrying, or positioning. When laying baby down, support the head until it's resting on the surface. Avoid jerky movements or letting the head 'flop.' This support is needed for the first few months until neck muscles strengthen and head control develops, typically around 3-4 months."

                  explanation: "Mild congestion and sneezing in newborns is usually normal as they clear amniotic fluid from their airways and adapt to breathing air. Newborns are obligate nose breathers and have narrow nasal passages that can sound congested. Sneezing helps clear the nasal passages and is a normal reflex. However, be concerned about difficulty breathing, persistent coughing, fever, poor feeding, or changes in activity level. Use a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator with saline drops if needed for comfort during feeding or sleeping. Avoid medications unless prescribed. Maintain good hygiene and limit exposure to sick individuals."

                  explanation: "Follow the CDC-recommended immunization schedule, which typically begins with Hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. Vaccines are most effective when given on schedule, and newborns are vulnerable to serious diseases that vaccines prevent. The schedule is designed based on when babies are most at risk and when their immune systems can best respond. Delaying vaccines leaves babies unprotected during vulnerable periods. Discuss any concerns with healthcare providers rather than delaying or skipping vaccines. Mild reactions like fussiness or low-grade fever are normal, but severe reactions should be reported immediately."

Apply a thin protective barrier (zinc oxide or petroleum jelly) if skin appears irritated. Avoid powder, which can be inhaled and cause respiratory problems. Use fragrance-free, alcohol-free products. If rash develops, increase air exposure, change diapers more frequently, and use thicker barrier cream. Persistent, severe, or spreading rashes may indicate infection and require medical evaluation. Some babies have sensitive skin and need extra protection."

Length increases about 1 inch per month, and head circumference grows about 0.5 inches per month. Developmental milestones for the first month include brief head lifting during tummy time, following objects with eyes, responding to sounds, and beginning to focus on faces. Sleeping through the night and rolling over are not expected until much later.

                  explanation: "Introduce pacifiers after breastfeeding is well established (typically 3-4 weeks) to avoid nipple confusion. Pacifiers can reduce SIDS risk when used for sleep, provide comfort during procedures, and help satisfy sucking needs between feeds. Offer at sleep times but don't force if baby refuses. Remove once baby falls asleep to prevent dependency. Avoid using pacifiers to delay feedings or as first response to crying. Choose one-piece designs without small parts, clean regularly, and replace when worn. Gradually wean around 6-12 months to prevent dental issues.

                  explanation: "Newborn blood sugar typically stabilizes through frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) as the baby's metabolism adjusts to life outside the womb. Risk factors for low blood sugar include prematurity, small or large birth weight, maternal diabetes, birth stress, and poor feeding. Signs of low blood sugar include jitteriness, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability, and abnormal crying. Early, frequent feeding (especially breastfeeding) is the best prevention. Healthcare providers monitor at-risk babies closely and may check blood sugar levels. Most healthy, full-term babies regulate blood sugar well with appropriate feeding.
